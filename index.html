                    <p>
                        I learned of Japan through diving into one of my
                        favorite animated characters as a child, Naruto. The language and culture of Japan
                        was the one I was most facinated by as a preteen. Being an isolated island with no land
                        borders with anyone else, they've developed different ways of approaching almost any concept
                        us in the Western World can fathom. Where we shake hands, they bow. While we see no big deal
                        if a train or bus was late, their transit systems are known to distribute notes to all passengers
                        if they ever go late by more than 5 minutes. This cultural experience is one large reason I feel
                        I'd fit well in Japan if I were to move there. Another influence from Japan is their healthcare
                        quality, and cost to users thereof. I simply wouldn't need the worry I have in the USA, although
                        that's a case with every other country on the list. The education system in Japan offers more
                        oppurtunities than simply one-size-fits-all high school. There's multiple types of high schools
                        anyone could attend. University tuition however, is still somewhat high for standards set by
                        the following countries, but still good compared to the USA.

                        My interest in Spain came from their national language being my second language.
                        Spain is thus the only mainland European country I could visit
                        at the time of writting this, and understand what everyone's saying. This, I see as the largest
                        advantage I have of moving here. I'm familiar with many aspects of Spanish culture, again
                        thanks to high school courses.

                        In 10th grade I met an exchange student from South Korea,
                        and was curious as to what his homeland was like.
