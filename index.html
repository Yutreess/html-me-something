                        I learned of Japan through diving into one of my
                        favorite animated characters as a child, Naruto. The language and culture of Japan
                        was the one I was most facinated by as a preteen. Being an isolated island with no land
                        borders with anyone else, they've developed different ways of approaching almost any concept
                        us in the Western World can fathom. Where we shake hands, they bow. While we see no big deal
                        if a train or bus was late, their transit systems are known to distribute notes to all passengers
                        if they ever go late by more than 5 minutes. This cultural experience is one large reason I feel
                        I'd fit well in Japan if I were to move there. Another influence from Japan is their healthcare
                        quality, and cost to users thereof. I simply wouldn't need the worry I have in the
                        <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, although
                        that's a case with every other country on the list. The education system in Japan offers more
                        oppurtunities than simply one-size-fits-all high school. There's multiple types of high schools
                        anyone could attend. University tuition however, is still somewhat high for standards set by
                        the following countries, but still good compared to the USA.

                        My interest in Spain came from their national language being my second language.
                        Spain is thus the only mainland European country I could visit
                        at the time of writting this, and understand what everyone's saying. This, I see as the largest
                        advantage I have of moving here. I'm familiar with many aspects of Spanish culture, again
                        thanks to high school courses. I find the lack of a language barrier a factor that could make
                        a move to Spain rather easy, since language for me can give rise to an identity with a nation.
                        The Spanish government functions much like that of the United Kingdom, it's officially a Kingdom,
                        but a democracy by all measurements possible. The King of Spain is more a cultural figure and/or
                        celebrity than a legitimate government official.

                        In 10th grade I met an exchange student from South Korea,
                        and was curious as to what his homeland was like. As I looked deeper into Korea, it seems a
                        great candidate for permanent life. The healthcare costs and quality are great, as is the educational
                        system, despite it's highly controlled structure. Much like the US, Korea's education system primarily
                        consists of elementary school, middle school, then high school, with very few exceptions. Only recently
                        has the Korean government announced plans to promote vocational schools. One shocking part of their system
                        is their national college entrance exam. Much like the ACT or SAT in the US, it's a test given in high
                        school that universities and colleges look at to evaluate potential students. The difference is that
                        no other college exam exists other than this national college exam, given and administered by the Korean
                        government. All air travel to Korea is banned on the testing day, in order to make sure no distractions
                        can hinder the students' most important day of high school.

                        My interest in France started from learning just how French the St. Louis area really is.
                        The name of my hometown of Florissant is French for "Flourishing". Anyone from
                        St. Louis recognizes the Fleur-de-lis, a symbol of France that integrated into several
                        parts of our community. The flags of St. Louis and Florisant contain this sybol of our French
                        origin, as does the <abbr title="Boy Scouts of America">BSA</abbr> that I was involved in for
                        8 years. France seems the easiest cultural transition, as my current residence fostered a love for
                        France strong enough that I feel I have a sort of French identity. Speaking of culture, the younger
                        demographic of France, those of my age, have views in their majoriy that are not too common among
                        the same age group in the United States. As in, more French young adults are indifferent about religion,
                        while religious views among American young adults are by a majority to some sect of Christianity.
                        French young adults are more so than Americans, supportive of family functions where both parents work
                        and take care of children & the home. Meanwhile in America, a more gender-specific family structure
                        is more prevalent than I would like. These disagreements would be far less likely to occur for me in 
                        France than in the States, which for me steers my eyes more to France than standing by.

                        I know Norway for their high rankings in overall citizen happiness. An interesting factor
                        to this is their election system, which would take hours for me to understnad fully, and more for
                        me to explain to anyone else. There are some similarities between Norwegian and German federal elections,
                        as they both modify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster/Sainte-Laguë_method">Sainte-Laguë Method</a>
                        to give parlimentary seats to candidates. This unique voting system is proven to be loved by Norwegians and
                        others worldwide, as there are pressures in the UK, USA, and Canada to institute their own modifications
                        of the Sainte-Laguë method to break the 2-party systems in the countries mentioned. The multi-party system
                        of government makes me much more confident that I'll find a party that closest mirrors my political stances.
                        As far as culture, Norway has similar, if not more appeal than that of France, as the trends mentioned there
                        are more pronounced between the USA and Norway than with the USA and France. A larger bonus to me, is
                        that university is free in Norway to all people who attend, not just Norwegian citizens. The living costs
                        are higher however, but this at least means moving to Norway means I only have to worry about affording
                        rent, phone service, internet, etc. and not pay any notice to tuition for university.

                        Similar to Norway, foreigners like myself can go to university for
                        a quite low tuition, and living costs! The Federal Govenrment has published a maximum tuition rate of
                        around 500&#8364; per semester. Moving to Germany would be another place where money is not an issue,
                        thus I could focus on practicing the German language, culture, traditions, and otherwise integrate into
                        German society. As far as Government, Germany is famous for
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany#Voting_system">their election system</a>,
                        which is simpler than that of Norway, yet still a minor challenge to understand. What separated Germany from
                        Norway in these similarities, is that Germany is much more populated, and spread among their land.
                        Rather than having one city with a large portion of their entire population, Germany has moderately large
                        places spread the entire country. There are 79 cities in Germany above 100,000 people, giving
                        room for plenty of options for cities to live in.
